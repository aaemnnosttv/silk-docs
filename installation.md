# Installation

## Via Composer (Recommended)

```
composer require silk/silk:^0.9
```

**Manual Installation**  
If you're not using a Composer-based WordPress project, you will need to require the Composer autoload file manually, or use the plugin.

```php
// eg: loading Composer within a theme functions.php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');
```

## WordPress Plugin
The WordPress.org plugin repository is not currently accepting library/framework type plugin requests.  

See the [silk-plugin repository](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/silk-plugin) for instructions on how to install and recommended usage.
