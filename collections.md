# Collections

Silk leverages the power of Collections in many places favor of plain arrays.

Currently the only dependency of the codebase, Silk pulls in the `Illuminate\Support\Collection` as part of the `tightenco/collect` package.

For comprehensive examples and documentation on using Collections, see the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/collections).
